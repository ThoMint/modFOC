#1 Gate Driver IC DRV8323
	-Linear voltage regulation and therefore running hot

#2 Silk Screen Error (fixed in v1.0)
	-Channel select Jumper Silk Screen reversed

#3 Extremely small shunt resistors
	-Low current resolution resulting in poor foc at higher speeds and lower power
	-too little filtering

#4 Enable failure of Gate Driver IC (fixed in v1.0)
	-AND Gate powered from Gater Driver not powered when disabled

#5 LEDS
	-too bright
	-high current consumption

#6 Input Output Protection
	Logic Levels only 3V3 and no Protection

#7 No Buffered ADC Input for VM
	ADC Inputs need to be buffered with amp

#8 No software reset for tmc
	use last channel of chip select mux for generel reset or bigger mux for individual reset

#9 Buttons unnecessary (fixed in v2.0)
	remove buttons

#10 unnecessary uart connector for tmcs (fixed in v2.0)
	replace connector with small solder pads
