#1 Gate Driver IC DRV8323
	-Linear voltage regulation and therefore running hot

#2 Silk Screen Error
	-Channel select Jumper Silk Screen reversed

#3 Extremely small shunt resistors
	-Low current resolution resulting in poor foc at higher speeds and lower power
	-too little filtering

#4 Enable failure of Gate Driver IC
	-AND Gate powered from Gater Driver not powered when disabled

#5 LEDS
	-too bright
	-high current consumption

#6 Input Output Protection
	Logic Levels only 3V3 and no Protection

#7 No Buffered ADC Input for VM
	ADC Inputs need to be buffered with amp

#8
